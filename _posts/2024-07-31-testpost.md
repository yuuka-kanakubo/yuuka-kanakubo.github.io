A project to launch my personal website had been on my bucket list for a long time.
The website is still under construction, but I am planning to include an introduction to my scientific works both for general audience and specialists. So, stay tuned!

Also, I would like to thank [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) for the pedagogical [Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). I, never having touched CSS and JavaScript before, could manage to build my website to be as close as possible to what I wanted.
