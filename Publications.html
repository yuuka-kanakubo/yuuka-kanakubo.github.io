        <div class="publication"  data-description="We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model, MC-EKRT, for computing partonic initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low pT particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low pT observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. In this proof-of-principle study, we average a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions and compute the rapidity and centrality dependence of the charged hadron multiplicities and elliptic flow for the LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC Au+Au collisions using 3+1 D viscous fluid-dynamical evolution. Also event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities are studied. The good agreement with the rapidity-dependent data suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has been very successful in explaining the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities.">

        <div class="publication"  data-description="We establish the updated version of dynamical core-corona initialization framework (DCCI2) as a unified description from small to large colliding systems and from low- to high-transverse-momentum pT regions. Using DCCI2, we investigate effects of interplay between locally equilibrated and nonequilibrated systems, in other words, core and corona components in high-energy nuclear collisions. Given experimental multiplicity distributions and yield ratios of Omega baryons to charged pions as inputs, we extract the fraction of core and corona components in p+p collisions at centre-of-mass energy of nucleon nucleon collisions 7 TeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. We find core contribution overtakes corona contribution as increasing multiplicity above dNdeta~20 regardless of the collision system or energy. We also see that the core contribution exceeds the corona contribution only in 0.0â€“0.95% multiplicity class in p+p collisions. Notably, there is a small enhancement of corona contribution with ~20% below pT~1 GeV even in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions. We find that the corona contribution at low pT gives ~15-30% correction on v2{2} at Nch less than ~400. This raises a problem in conventional hydrodynamic analyses in which low pT soft hadrons originate solely from core components.
